# File Organizer

A simple Python script that organizes files in a directory by file extension.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.



The script will then organize the files in the specified directory by file extension.

## Customization

By default, the script will create a new directory for each file extension and move all files with that extension to the corresponding directory. If you want to customize this behavior, you can modify the script's source code.
