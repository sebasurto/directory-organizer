# Directory Organizer
A Python script to organize a directory's files into folders by file extension. For example, if you have a directory with music, image, and document files, this script will move each type of file to its corresponding folder.

## Requirements
To use this script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

## Usage
Clone this repository on your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/sebasurto/directory-organizer.git

```
Run the script.

A dialog window will open to let you select the directory you want to organize.

Click on the "Organize" button to start the organization process.

The files of the selected directory will be organized into folders by file extension.

## Customization
You can customize this script by modifying the following variables in the .py files:

DESTINATION_DIRECTORY: The directory in which the folders for the organized files will be created.

EXTENSIONS: A list of file extensions that should be organized. You can add or remove extensions as needed.

## Graphical User Interface
The script includes a graphical user interface created with the tkinter Python library. The GUI features a directory selection button, an organize button, and a dialog window to show the user when the organization is complete.
